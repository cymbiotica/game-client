Built With
Jquery
Bootstrap
Html
Ajax
Javascripts
Css3
SASS

I used HTML5 to build the basic structure of the app and CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap to style.

The forms and modals were done using Bootstrap.

Javascript is used to build the game logic, send AJAX calls and jQuery is used to interact with the DOM and update the view
